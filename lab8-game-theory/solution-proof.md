For the R round, N agents Tragedy of the Commons game, with the given utility function, in the case where the remaining resource is always *doubling* at each round:

   u(ag_i, ag_(-i)) = ln(pi * K) + ln[K - sum_j(p_j * K)]

the optimal social utility value of p_i is for it to be equal to a single value *p* which is 1 / (NR + N)

See proof in the attached jpegs.
