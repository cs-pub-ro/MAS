TODO Improvements
-----------------
  - set an additional map size: 30x30
  - implement a method to view the distribution of timesteps when each prey agent is killed
    - this is as a metric to test if communication (base on signaling where prey is) helps more in the start / mid game, than it does in the end-game (where mostly the exploration strategy will be of importance) -> this is believed to be true for the small map
